    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>I mainly play lots of video games during quarantine and before quarantine.
            I find them very fun but every once in a while I feel like going out. I 
            like to lie down outside in my free time to just relax. Lying down is 
            very relaxing especially on the trampoline. Another thing I like to do during
            quarantine is having a barbeque outside, I like grilling meats and other stuff aswell.

<h1>Description</h1>
    <p>I mainly play lots of video games during quarantine and before quarantine.
        I find them very fun but every once in a while I feel like going out. I 
        like to lie down outside in my free time to just relax. Lying down is 
        very relaxing especially on the trampoline. Another thing I like to do during
        quarantine is having a barbeque outside, I like grilling meats and other stuff aswell.
